# Accessible budget
Monthly budget manager developed with accessibility in mind.

## Background
I am a student in web development. I want to learn and practice new skills around the concept of "digital accessibility".
It happens that I also need an app to manage the family monthly budget, 
and I have to work on a personal project in order to graduate in November 2022.

## Main objectives
1. Learn new skills and potentially new libraries and/or framework.
2. Make it work.
3. Make sure it is secured.
4. Make sure the app does comply with A11Y recommendations
5. Push it online and make it available to everyone.
6. Make contact with non-profit organisations.

## Specs
As a student, I am aware that I have a lot to learn, yet I am eager to give my best and develop the app with:
- Php 8
- Api-platform (a library that works with symfony)
- React.js or Vue.js
- TailwindCss
- PostgreSQL
- Heroku

domain name: accessible-budget.org / accessible-budget.fr / access-budget.org / access-budget.fr
